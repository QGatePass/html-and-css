        <h2 id="hist">Breed History</h2>
        <p id="dff">The braird which is believed to have originated from France, has been bred for centuries to herd and protect sheep. The breed was used 
            by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers beacuse of it's fine sense of hearing. Brairds were used in the First World war
            almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of brairds is slowly recovering. Charlemange, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned brairds.
