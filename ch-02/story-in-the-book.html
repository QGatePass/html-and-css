        <h1>The story in the Book  </h1>
        <h2><p>Chapter 1</p></h2>
        <p>Molly had been sitting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
            lying between the copies of <i>Nature,New Scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work
            had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road.</cite> It had been Molly's favourite book 
            since college and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
            proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many
            considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> , to be an
            outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
